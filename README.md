# URL-SHORTENER-PYTHON
Welcome to the URL Shortener project! This is a Python-based desktop application that shortens long URLs into shorter, more manageable links using TinyURL API.

# Description
This project was created as a task for my internship at Sync Interns. It uses Python's Tkinter GUI library and the TinyURL API to create a simple desktop application that allows users to enter long URLs and receive shorter URLs in return. The shorter URLs can then be used to access the original long URLs.
